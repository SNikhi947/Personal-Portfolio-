    <h1>I'm Nikhil Kumar</h1>

    <p>
      Hello! I’m Nikhil Kumar, a Computer Science Engineering student at Kuppam Engineering College, currently in my third year. I'm someone who believes in the power of technology to transform lives and bring ideas to reality — whether it’s through building simple apps, contributing to community-driven tech, or continuously exploring the latest in software development.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a CGPA of 9.018, I’ve built a solid foundation in programming (Java, Python, C), web development, and databases. My journey so far has been a mix of academic learning, hands-on mini-projects, and certified online courses that helped me dive into topics like Full Stack Development, MongoDB, AI, and even process mining with Celonis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond academics, I’m actively involved in extracurriculars — from NSS volunteering and participating in awareness campaigns, to attending film workshops with inspiring industry professionals like Karthik Subbaraj and many more. These experiences have helped me grow not just as a coder but as a communicator, teammate, and problem solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      My learning style is simple: Learn. Build. Reflect. Repeat. I enjoy solving real-world problems, whether through a group project like building a calculator or by improving myself through certification programs from Google, AICTE, and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside the tech world, you’ll find me writing scripts, playing cricket, binge-watching movies and web series, or just brainstorming crazy app ideas with friends. I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and challenges. Let’s connect and create something impactful!
